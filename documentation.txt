Our bot takes the WLSeattle.csv file, which contains these columns "Date", "W/L", "Attendance", "Location".
The bot is acting as a weather man. In order to use the bot, you will have to provide it the date of the Seattle
baseball home game and only in the year of 2015.
If you don't provide it a date, it will ask you nicely to please provide that information so that it can pull the data
desired.
